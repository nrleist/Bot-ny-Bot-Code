Contains all of the neccesary components and libraries to compile a proteus C++ project into an .s19 file.

Rather than actual firmware, this repo is considered part of the hardware abstraction layer (HAL). HAL is implemented in software that is between the physical hardware of a computer and the software. The Proteus cannot operate without the libraries in the repo, which is similar to firmware, but it is not permanent like typical firmware.

You can find API documentation for the libraries in this repo at u.osu.edu/fehproteus.
